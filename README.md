# Use Case
The main use case I have in mind is for switching between sets of tiles depending on the scale in cm cox for the thieving room.

Routes from the door to the trough vary based on team size and whether the team is using telegrab.

# Configuration
Users can change the name of the buttons in the sidebar via the settings for the plugin, as well as input different sets of tiles for each button. In order to add a set of tiles, export ground markers normally and paste the output into the desired section. If the tiles are in a valid format (i.e. Ground Markers is able to import them) they will appear properly when the associated profile is selected via the sidebar icon.
